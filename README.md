🜃 Sanctuary Kernel

A privacy-first ephemeral reflection interface.
Forget by design. Vanish by choice.


---

🌿 Mission

Sanctuary Kernel offers a digital space where reflections bloom and dissolve without trace.
No surveillance, no storage—just presence and release.


---

🌌 Why Sanctuary Exists

In a world addicted to data retention, Sanctuary Kernel provides a counterbalance:

No identifiers. No tracking. No retention.

Volatile memory only — offerings fade after 12 seconds.

An ephemeral ritual, not a permanent record.
